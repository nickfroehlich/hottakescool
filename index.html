    <h1 id="mainhead">nick and jake's hot takes</h1>
    <p><b>elevators and escalator deaths are underreported worldwide due to the possible national security risk:</b> There are an absurd number of elevators and escalators in U.S. office buildings and other structures (nearly one million in the U.S., according to the National Elevator Industry, Inc.). Imagine the crisis that our country would go through if we discovered that every elevator and escalator is actually just a murder machine. And there’s no way that only 60 people per year die by elevator or escalator. There’s no way. I’m not buying it. (This is the one and only Hot Take not supported by any facts).</p>
    <p><b>umbrellas are socially irresponsible:</b> Umbrellas are bad if there are more than a few people outside. If the streets are empty, sure, wave that nylon canopy high. But when it’s pouring rain and the streets are packed, it’s just irresponsible: you drip water on everyone else and, depending on your height, poke people in the face. At a certain point everybody’s gotta just throw up their arms and say “alright, we’re all gonna be wet today and that's okay.”</p>
    <p><b>waluigi is the most topical and accurate character in the mario/nintendo universe:</b>Given that Luigi is simply a reflection of Mario and Wario is Mario’s inverse, it stands to reason that Waluigi is simply the inverse of Mario’s reflection. Waluigi only exists because of who is not, rather than who he is. In many ways, that’s who we are, too: Think about how you define yourself when you scroll through Facebook and see the successful, happy people that you're not. That is, as well as your life, Waluigi’s. </p>
